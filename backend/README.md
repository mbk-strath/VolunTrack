## Troubleshooting

**Email Issues**: Ensure you're using Gmail App Passwords, not regular passwords. Enable 2FA first, then generate an App Password.

**Database Connection**: Verify MySQL is running and credentials are correct in `.env`

**Wrong Controller Issues**: `Run composer install && php artisan optimize`

**Cache Issues**: Run `php artisan config:clear && php artisan config:cache` if configuration changes don't take effect

**Database issues**: Incase of conflicting migrations or new migrations or modifications on the old migrations. Run `php migrate:fresh`

**Image Storage Issues**: Make sure your storage/app/public directory is linked to public/storage by running `php artisan storage:link`
